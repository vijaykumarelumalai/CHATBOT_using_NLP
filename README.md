# Advanced Chatbot Development with NLP

This project demonstrates the development of an advanced chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with TensorFlow and Keras. The model leverages a Transformer-based architecture, specifically BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), pre-trained on large text corpora, and fine-tunes it for conversational AI tasks. It also includes various preprocessing steps, tokenization, and training strategies like learning rate scheduling and early stopping.

## Introduction

This project aims to create a sophisticated chatbot capable of understanding and generating human-like text responses. Using the BERT architecture, fine-tuned on conversational data, the chatbot is designed to handle a wide range of user inputs and provide contextually relevant responses.

## Dataset

The training dataset consists of a large corpus of conversational text. The data is split into training and validation sets, ensuring a diverse representation of dialogues. Key components include:
- *Training Data:* A collection of dialogues with paired questions and responses.
- *Validation Data:* A separate set of dialogues used for model evaluation.

## Model Architecture

The chatbot model is built using the BERT architecture as the base model. BERT is pre-trained on vast text corpora and fine-tuned for conversational tasks. The architecture includes:
- *Base Model:* BERT (pre-trained on large text corpora)
- *Additional Layers:* 
  - Dense Layer with 512 units and ReLU activation
  - Dropout Layer with a 0.3 dropout rate
  - Dense Layer with the number of units equal to the vocabulary size and Softmax activation (output layer)

## Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is crucial for preparing the data for the BERT model. Steps include:
- Tokenization using the BERT tokenizer
- Padding and truncating sequences to a fixed length
- Creating attention masks to indicate padding positions

## Training Strategy

The model training incorporates several advanced techniques:
- *Learning Rate Scheduler:* Adjusts the learning rate based on the epoch number.
- *Model Checkpoint:* Saves the best model during training.
- *Early Stopping:* Stops training if the validation loss does not improve for 5 consecutive epochs.

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- NumPy

## Usage

To use the chatbot, run the following steps:
1. Install the necessary libraries.
2. Load the trained model and tokenizer.
3. Preprocess the input text.
4. Generate responses using the model.

Example code snippet:
```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertForSequenceClassification
import tensorflow as tf

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('path/to/saved/model')
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Preprocess input text
input_text = "Hello, how are you?"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="tf", padding=True, truncation=True)

# Generate response
outputs = model(inputs)
response = tf.argmax(outputs.logits, axis=-1)
print(f"Response: {response}")
```

## Results

The model achieves high performance on the validation set, demonstrating strong conversational abilities. Metrics such as accuracy, perplexity, and F1-score are used to evaluate the model's effectiveness.
